                <strong>Overall rating (1.75/5): </strong>
                    <p>CoGo is a relatively new addition to the ever-expanding world of fintech. The free app allows consumers align their spending choices and values. CoGo provides its users with a real-time, personalised carbon footprint tracker and reviews your banking activity to report how much carbon you are creating through your spending habits. According to CoGo’s managing director Emma Kisby, the company’s founder and CEO (Ben Glassier) intuitively understood the limitations of government policy so he wanted to focus on “empowering consumers with better information to make informed choices”. Admittedly, this philosophy is very similar to VOIZ’, but at its core it could be argued that CoGo’s business model is somewhat flawed and raises an age-old dilemma. Should the responsibility rest solely on consumers to make sustainable choices? Should there not be a greater emphasis on the accountability of corporations? While CoGo does admittedly work with companies to improve their business models I still feel that the emphasis is still disproportionality on the purchasing power of consumers. However, overall I was pleasantly surprised by the CoGo app, particularly the company’s concern for the welfare and treatment of workers, this is a refreshing departure from the often-myopic focus of many corporations who conceptualise ‘sustainability’ purely in terms of its environmental implications. Indeed, CoGo’s Impact Model equally emphasises the importance of securing ‘positive long-term social and environmental impacts. However, my main gripe with CoGo is their close association with a number of major banks and companies who have a problematic track record when it comes to climate justice and social action. While I sympathise to an extend with CoGo as a young start-up in need of funding to expand and grow I feel that they have compromised their core values by aligning themselves with these corporations. </p>
				<strong>What it’s made of (1.75/5): </strong>	
                    <p>CoGo’s app is available on apple and android. The app connects straight to your bank account and reviews your incoming and outgoing transactions to create a monthly carbon profile. Your carbon consumption is then broken down into: Food and drink, Around my home, Stuff I buy, Getting around and a final miscellaneous category ‘unknown’. Arguably however, because CoGo only tracks your purchases there still could be plenty of activities that contribute to your overall carbon consumption that are not accounted for. For instance, if you live in a household and ask someone else to buy an extra batch of eggs for you or spend a gift voucher at a retail store you are still adding to your overall carbon consumption – it’s just that these activities do not always leave behind a traceable digital footprint so they cannot be taken into consideration. Nonetheless, what really sets CoGo apart from similar carbon footprint calculators is the way in which it actually translates your financial data into a set of workable solutions so that the user can meaningfully alter their spending habits and offset their carbon footprint. The app even converts your monthly carbon consumption into the equivalent number of trees cut down or mileage travelled. I think this really helps the user to visualise in a more digestible way the tangible effect their actions have on the environment. This monthly data is further contextualised by measuring it against a baseline UK average as well as an optimal  ‘goal’ of 180kg to lead a ‘Sustainable Lifestyle’.  </p>
                    <p>CoGo’s recommended solutions are based upon the users’ pre-selected values. The user can choose from 12 values to help guide their purchasing decisions, these include: reduce waste, social enterprise, living wage and fairly traded etc. While I think giving the users the options to select their own values helps to tailor the experience to the preferences of each individual – this raises a slightly difficult question. Should consumers really be allowed to be selective about which values we opt in and out of? Shouldn’t we all be held to the same if not similar standard? I was initially suspicious about how CoGo vetted companies to satisfy these different values – that was until I accessed their ‘Good Impact Framework’ document which went through the criteria according to every value. For each certification a company must pass CoGo’s Issue-Action-Badge-Impact test. First CoGo will identify the key ethical issue for the consumer, next the business must consider what actions need to be taken to respond to the consumers concerns, then the company must produce a badge or certification to prove it is working to improve its practices and finally the overall impact of the businesses improved practices must be calculated. However, I still felt upon further investigation that some of the criteria necessary to satisfy the individual values was not stringent enough. For instance, in order to qualify under their ‘Sustainably Sourced’ value a company need only produce evidence that at least one of their products has been certified by an organisation from a pre-approved list as well as an itemised list of the products sold by a particular company and an overall number of how many ‘sustainably sourced’ products are available from their entire stock list. Surely having one sustainable product does not redeem an entire company? Similarly, for a company to be considered ‘Cruelty Free’ they are only expected to sell at least one brand or product that is certified by one of CoGo’s trusted organisations. The issue here is that a consumer might change their purchasing habits according to the recommendations of CoGo under the assumption that the brands have been rigorously scrutinised to meet their personal values – only to discover that CoGo’s own criteria leaves a lot to be desired. CoGo’s app also has a search bar which allows you to look for trusted companies that sell the particular item you are looking for. However, the issue I encountered with this search function is that the recommended stores listed that were not very local to me so the suggested search results were not very useful. Perhaps the scarcity of local businesses in my search results reflects the size of the platform, hopefully as CoGo’s operation scales-up the relevancy of its search function will also improve. Furthermore, at its core CoGo hopes to improve consumer awareness and they definitely achieve this, they also offer users the options to receive personalised notifications to help “boost your positive spends”. Clearly, CoGo understands the importance of user engagement and regular push-notifications to remain at the forefront of people’s minds.</p>
                    <p>But CoGo doesn’t just help consumers, they also actively work with companies to improve their sustainable performance. The CoGo Impact Model states that the company helps to measure the ROI (Returns on investment) of their existing CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives and helps develop new strategies that will generate even better results using consumer data. In doing so, CoGo seeks to reassure companies that sustainable practices can actually be an additive to their business model rather than a detractor.</p>

                    <strong>How it’s made (2.0/5): </strong>
                    <p>CoGo’s carbon emissions tracker tool was developed by the company’s CEO in collaboration with their in-house data science team, world-renowned climate expert Mike Berners-Lee as well as data provided by Leeds University Professor John Barrett. Barret’s data has also been used by the UK government and WWF which is clearly a testament to its reliability. Your actual carbon footprint is calculated by analysing your banking data and matching each transaction to its relevant industry (food, sport, fashion etc.). The transaction is then multiplied by a generic ‘emissions factor’ for that specific industry. This emissions factor is adjusted according to the sustainability performance of the company and information specific to the consumer’s lifestyle e.g vegetarian, vegan etc. </p>
                    <p>However, some aspects of this carbon emissions calculator are speculative. According to CoGo the carbon emissions factor assumes its user ‘buys an average mix of products when you shop’. Therefore, say you actually only buy multiples of one item the generic multiplier will not necessarily create an accurate reading of your carbon consumption. In CoGo’s defence, they are well aware of the limitations of their carbon tracker and concede that it is “imperfect, but .. the best solution available”. I feel that CoGo’s tracker as it stands strikes the best balance possible by drawing educated conclusions from the data available to them without overstepping the line and being too invasive. They have also identified areas for improvement going forward which suggests that they are not prepared to simply rest on the laurels and have a long-term vision to develop their services. </p>
                    <strong>Who makes it (0.5/5): </strong>
                    <p> CoGo’s founder and CEO, Ben Gleisner, in his own words wanted to create a platform that uses the “power of people, technology and data to fundamentally change the world for good”. Gleisner appears to have an extensive background in sustainability and social justice, as the founder of conscious consumer (a marketing platform for sustainable platforms) and a former economist for the New Zealand treasury – who helped to develop the Treasury’s Living standard’s Framework in 2011. CoGo’s team of employees currently operate out of London, Wellington and Melbourne. I was really impressed by the level of diversity in CoGo’s senior management team in each of their international offices. CoGo certainly delivers on its promise of creating a platform where “each voice matters”, in fact 9 of its 12 senior marketing team in their Wellington based office are women, that constitutes a startling 75%. This is a really refreshing departure from the often exclusionary, predominantly male senior management infrastructure at most companies. Indeed, it seems that New Zealand nationally outperforms most of the world in terms of the number of women in senior management roles – with 28% of positions held by women, 4% above the global average. CoGo’s commitment to sustainable action and climate justice is also attested to by their impressive collection of certifications, including a Toitu Carbon Zero certification and their B corporation certification.  </p>
                    <p>However, the more you peel back the curtain and investigate CoGo’s various investors and shareholders, the less their claims to sustainable climate action hold weight. In 2020, CoGo announced its partnership with Australian bank Westpac in order to “empower businesses and citizens … to build [a] low-carbon economy”. However, this partnership seems to be inconsistent with CoGo’s sustainable corporate values given that Westpac has previously come under fire for its role in funding the New Zealand Mining corporation Bathurst. Similarly, despite professing to care about corporate responsibility – Westpac has faced significant criticism for its involvement in logging operations in the Solomon Islands. To add further insult to injury, as recently as 2019 the bank was once again caught up in the midst of another scandal after an investigation by Austrac revealed that it was guilty of money laundering and child exploitation offences. The bank was subsequently forced to pay a hefty fine of $1.3billion.</p>
                    <p>But Westpac isn’t the only dubious corporation with a vested financial interest in CoGo, for instance one of the company’s major shareholders is James Watt, the CEO of the pub chain BrewDog. In 2021, over 100 of BrewDog’s former employees came forward to share their experiences of bullying and harassment in what has been described as a “culture of fear” while working for the company. The letter also criticised the company’s blatant greenwashing – professing to care for the environment all the while chartering a private plane and wasting glacier water to manufacture its line of craft beers.</p>
                    <p>So surely that’s it right? Well not exactly, another one of CoGo's shareholders is the former CEO of the National Australia Bank (NAB), Andrew Thorburn. Under Thorburn’s leadership in the period between 2016-2019 the bank loaned an astonishing $7.3 billion to the fossil fuel industry before finally being forced to resign in 2019 after an investigation by the Royal Commission exposed the greedy, toxic culture at NAB. Clearly, CoGo needs to better vet its prospective investors and shareholders to ensure that they align with the company’s own values. However, perhaps it is unrealistic to expect CoGo to exclusively work with companies who have perfectly polished reputations. By integrating CoGo’s tools into their services, corporations can begin to reconfigure their business models and make more sustainable choices.</p>
