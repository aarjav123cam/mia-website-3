React website I made for my friend, it includes articles, is responsive and a floating navbar. This project started using the repo from Tharindu N. Madhusanka, but I had to change many of the components, add pages and edit layouts to fit the custom requirements of this project.

The site is hosted using Netfliy and is at: [https://mia-warren.netlify.app](https://mia-warren.netlify.app)
